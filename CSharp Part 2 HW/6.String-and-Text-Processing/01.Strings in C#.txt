Problem 1. Strings in C#.

Describe the strings in C#.
What is typical for the string data type?
Describe the most important methods of the String class.

Answer:
A string is a sequential collection of Unicode characters that is used to represents text. A String object is a sequential collection of System.Char objects that represents a string. The value of the String object is the content of the sequential collection, and that value is immutable (read-only). The maximum size  of a String object in memory is 2 GB, or about 1 billion characters. This type allows us to manipulate character data through different methods and properties.

Some of the most important methods are the following:
* Get length of the string (text.Length)
* Convert to uppercase (text.ToUpper())
* Convert to lowercase (text.ToLower())
* Substring (text.Substring())
* Remove leading or trailing whitespace (text.Trim())
* Split String by a char (text.Split(' '))
* Finding the index of a element(or string) (text.IndexOf())
* Creating a copy of the string(not the reference var) (text. Copy())
* Checks if two reference vars are equal (object.ReferenceEquals(,))
* Concatenates 2 strings (string.Concat(,))
* Append (similar to concatenate) text = text + textToAppend
* Replacing text in string (text. Replace(,))
* Comparison string.Compare(), or string1.CompareTo(string2)
	- returns 1 if the string1 is bigger than string2
	- returns -1 if the string2 is bigger than string1
	- returns 0 if they are of the same size
